TODO Bug and issues

* Starting players message box f.ex.. "Pikachu's: Turn" always shows,
  while secondary player never appears.

* Hero can still attack even if opponent i captured.

* Had issues with opponents auto attack only playing animation, not dealing damage.

TODO I wonder if...

* Rethinking how the message box should work.

* Using a redbox with "Oppoents turn" as overlay on hero buttons, could I use this for other states?
